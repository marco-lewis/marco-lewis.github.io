This is a late Hello World post for my website/blog.
I intend on using this website to keep updates on my current work and other tools and I will be making occasional blogs.
The blogs will be a mix of ideas, thoughts and reports on some of my experiences (such as the trip report I wrote last month).
Don't expect the blog posts to be too frequent, but I'll see what I upload.

I'll leave it at that for now.
We'll see what the future holds.
