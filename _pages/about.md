I am a PhD student at Newcastle University, supervised by Sadegh Soudjani and Paolo Zuliani. My research area is the intersection between quantum computing and formal verification, where I am investigating how quantum programs can be verified using automated verification techniques.

Before starting my postgraduate studies at Newcastle University, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol.
