I am a postdoc researcher in the QuaCS group with Inria located at Université Paris-Sacly. My research area is the intersection between quantum computing and formal verification, where I am investigating how different areas of the quantum stack can be verified using automated verification techniques.

Before starting my postdoc, I studied my PhD at Newcastle University under Sadegh Soudjani and Paolo Zuliani. Before that, I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Bristol.
